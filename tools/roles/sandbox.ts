/**
 * The sandbox a worker or verifier runs in, so a role can only see and change its own workspace.
 *
 * scripts/work and scripts/verify load this with `pi -e`, and set ROLE_WORKSPACE to the role's workspace (also its
 * working directory), ROLE_ALLOW_READ to any other folders it must read (the Node install), and ROLE_ALLOW_WRITE to the
 * parts of the workspace it may change (default: all of it), each list separated by ":".
 *
 * - bash runs under the operating system's sandbox (sandbox-exec on macOS, through @anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime):
 *   reading anything under /Users or the temporary folders is refused except the workspace and ROLE_ALLOW_READ,
 *   writing is refused outside ROLE_ALLOW_WRITE, and the only network is loopback (the role's own product). Its shell
 *   gets a folder beside the workspace as its home and temporary folder (outside the workspace's git repository: the
 *   product's credential store refuses to save inside one), no global git configuration, and the role's drive on its PATH.
 * - read refuses any path outside the workspace; write and edit refuse any path outside ROLE_ALLOW_WRITE.
 * - If the sandbox cannot start, bash refuses every command: a role never runs unconfined.
