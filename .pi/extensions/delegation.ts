/**
 * Before the coordinator delegates, a fresh reader says back what it would understand from the text.
 *
 * The first time this session runs scripts/work on a task, or scripts/steer with a message, the call is blocked. The
 * task (and, for a steer, the message as it arrives during that task) goes, with nothing else, to the worker's own
 * model, which says back in plain words what it would do, why it believes the work is wanted, and what done looks
 * like. The block shows that restatement beside the text. Where they differ, the text failed to carry its reason, and
 * the coordinator rewrites it; where they agree, the identical command goes through. A changed task or message is new
 * text and is read afresh. `scripts/steer --stop` and scripts/verify (the verifier gets Owen's outcome, not the
 * coordinator's words) pass untouched. One delegation goes per command, and a task is named as its file.
 *
 * The gate sees a command before it runs, so it cannot see everything: a loop's task paths, or an edit made in the same
 * round of tool calls (Pi checks every call of a round before running any). So the reader leaves word of each text it
 * read (.runs/read/<sha256>), and scripts/work and scripts/steer refuse a text it has not read.
 *
 * The reader is given what every worker starts with (AGENTS.md) and the design's Scope (design/decisions.md), and
 * judges, as a capable reader sharing that purpose, whether the text would lead a worker somewhere the purpose would not
 * want (Owen, October 16: most of what went wrong in delegation traced to the coordinator's task wording, which the
 * reader is placed to see).
 *
 * Why (Owen, October 7): the coordinator kept handing workers rules where it meant reasons (the primitives' rules
 * instead of the organizing idea, failure cases a worker then wrote into the product's instructions). Asking it to re-read
 * its own text "as the one receiving it" did not hold: it ran the command again without re-reading. So the reading is
 * done by someone who actually knows nothing of why the work exists, the same kind of agent that will receive it.

for something is that someone decided, approved or asked for it, name that part. Where the text keeps, adjusts, works
around or defers to something that already exists (a rule, a number, a mechanism, a test, a record's shape, a review, a
