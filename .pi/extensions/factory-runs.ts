/**
 * The coordinator's view of the runs it dispatches: told when each finishes, and shown each live beside the session.
 *
 * scripts/work and scripts/verify write each run to <checkout>/.runs/<run>.log, record the session that started them
 * ("=== dispatched by session <id>", from Pi's PI_SESSION_ID), tee Pi's JSON event stream to .runs/<run>.jsonl and end
 * the log with "=== finished exit <n>" (tools/feed/runs.mjs says when a run is waiting, running or finished). This watches the .runs/ folder of every checkout of the repository.
 *
 * Told: when a run this session dispatched finishes, it sends this session a message (which starts a turn, or follows
 * the current one) with the run, its exit status, its checkout's newest commit and, for a verifier, its WORKS and BROKEN
 * counts. Other sessions' runs, and runs started outside Pi, are not reported.
 *
 * Shown: when this session runs inside Ghostty, each run it dispatches opens as a read-only feed (tools/feed/feed, Pi's
 * own transcript view of the run) in a split to the right of this session's pane; several runs stack in that column.
 * The feed closes its own pane a few seconds after its run finishes. Ctrl+Shift+R hides every feed of this session, or
 * shows again those still running (or, when none is, the newest run this session dispatched). Splitting never takes the
 * keyboard: focus goes back to the pane that had it, without bringing Ghostty to the front.
 *
 * Ghostty's AppleScript names a pane only by id, title and folder, and two Pi sessions in one checkout share the last
 * two. So this finds its own pane when it needs it: it sets the terminal title to a one-off tag, asks Ghostty which pane
 * carries it and puts the title back (about 0.1 s), then keeps that id while the pane exists. Nothing depends on where
 * focus was when the session started, so reload, resume and a pane moved to another tab or window all work. Feed panes
 * are found by their title, "⧉ <run>", which the feed sets, so no state survives in memory between reloads.
 *
 * Only the interactive session watches; workers and verifiers run Pi in JSON mode and skip it.
